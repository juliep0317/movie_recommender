# Project: Movie Recommender

## Objective: 
### Create a Python script that recommends movies based on user preferences using booleans, logical operators, and conditional statements.

### Project requirements:

- Booleans: The user's responses to the yes/no questions are stored as boolean values (True or False).
- Logical operators: The and and not operators are used to combine the boolean values and determine the movie genre.
- Conditional statements: The if-elif-else statements are used to recommend movies based on the determined genre.

This project provided a practical way to implement my learning of Booleans, Logical Operators and Conditional Statements.
